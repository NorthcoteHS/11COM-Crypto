					<h2>What are cryptocurrencies?</h2>
                    <p>Cryptocurrencies are digital form of currency protected through encryption and cryptography. These currencies are not issued nor controlled by any central authority, making it immune from manipulation from governmental interference. Various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and many others have recently had their breakthrough within recent years, gaining massive media attention internationally. Since all transactions are not monitored/made anonymously, there are security features that are implemented to prevent fraud/theft through a "blockchain".</p>
                    <hr />
					<h2>Main aim and outlook of cryptocurrency</h2>
                    <p>Each country has varying maturities of regulatory frameworks, there are significant inconsistencies between countries as they tackle regulation due to the continuous innovation and technology enhancements being made to the blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Governments around the world have facilitated white papers, sought feedback from subject matter experts, monitoring of cryptocurrencies as they work through a complicated new set of frameworks to regulate cryptocurrencies. The aim of these frameworks is to balance innovation and also ensure safety and security for consumers and to minimise criminal activities.</p>
                    <p>Decentralisation of currency is what consumers are looking for as people are getting fed up with governments controlling the financial systems and fiat currencies. Being a new technology, a balanced regulatory framework is critical to the success of Cryptocurrencies. It is critical that regulation does not stifle innovation.</p>
                    <hr />
                    <h2>What's causing cryptocurrency volatility?</h2>
                    <p>Market Volatility is an issue within Cryptocurrency because it affects investors, exchanges, miners, banks, blockchain users, governments/authorities and the Crypto businesses/companies themselves. Put simply, each cryptocurrency is a different company that is striving to ultimately fix a problem or enhance users experience with things. Cryptocurrency is a relatively new piece of software meaning there is a lot of speculation causing the highly volatile market.</p>

						<h2>Solutions</h2>
                        <p>As a precursor step it is recommended that all global exchanges are linked to remove arbitrage pricing for cryptocurrencies.</p>
                        <p>It's highly recommended that different countries continue to monitor developments across the cryptocurrency sector as it is rapidly evolving.</p>
                        <p>It's also advisable that a global peak body is setup, working in collaboration with global experts in cryptocurrencies to draft a global framework for cryptocurrency regulation by all nations. (Similarly to the Paris Climate Change Accord).</p>
                        <p>Constant collaboration to seek feedback to include and exclude ideas and concepts and to seek agreement after significant consultations with government, businesses, consumers, regulators and others</p>
                        <p>It is advised that these new frameworks are balanced and flexible as to encourage innovation.</p>
                        <p>It is noted that the implementation of these agreed new frameworks requires significant time so a staged implementation of these frameworks is required.</p>
                        <p>Once when the new global regulatory frameworks and protocols have been embedded by regulators around the world. It is expected that each sovereign nation will have and add additional and more detailed rules and regulation that are specific to their own individual requirements. Such as the treatment of tax, accounting, financial.... etc controls.</p>
