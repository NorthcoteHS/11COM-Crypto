							<h2>How does market volatility affect investors?</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Cryptocurrency investing is a highly volatile market that can lead to incredible profits, in the same manner, their is a possibility of major losses. There are a many factors that affect a particular Cryptocurrencies price and worth. Day traders, people that speculate on coins and invest large amounts of money for small profits over a short period of time, find that the marketâ€™s high volatility is beneficial. With sufficient research and knowledge of both the software and market trends, the chances of profits are greater. There are very few people that are knowledgeable enough and have had success in day trading over a sustained period of time. Long term investors study particular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, litecoin and ripple. There are many more, with more being added each day, meaning potential investment opportunities. Long term holding of cryptocurrencies the user believes has potential and a future is generally regarded to be a better strategy for profits. Ultimately, investing in anything involves some amount of risk, whether that be a house, a share in a stock or Bitcoin.</p>
