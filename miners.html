							<h2>How does market volatility affect miners?</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Cryptocurrency is created through a mathematical process that uses large quantities of computing power from different components to solve complex mathematical equations. After the equation is completed a bitcoin is produced for instance. Miners then get bitcoin in reward for successfully completing the equation. When bitcoin is trading at roughly $8,000 USD it makes it difficult for miners to make any profit because they have to pay for the electricity they use to run the many computers it takes to complete the equation. Since cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and the trading prices fluctuates a lot, "some miners may simply turn off the machines until the price comes back a bit," said Shone Anstey, co-founder and president of Blockchain Intelligence Group. This is because it is not worth mining bitcoin unless the trading price is greater than the cost of mining it.</p>
